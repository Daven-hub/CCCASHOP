The choice of Canada and the French-speaking and Anglephone African countries is linked to a unifying vision under the paradigm of institutional Francophonie.

On the other hand, in French-speaking Africa, the Communes, as they are called, are only slowly beginning to free themselves from the political supervision of the central government. The establishment of the Ministries of Decentralization and Regional Planning in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Cameroon, contributes to this new approach to territorial governance focused on the development and autonomy of the Communes. Following this approach, the majority of these French-speaking African countries have set up a supra-municipal organization: the Association of Mayors of Senegal (AMS), the Union of Cities and Municipalities of Côte d'Ivoire (UVICOCI), the Association of Municipalities of Burkina Faso (AMBF), the National Association of Cities and Municipalities of the DRC (ANVC/DRC), the Association of Mayors of Gabon (AMG) and the United Municipalities and Cities of Cameroon (CVUC)."

As the administrative and political unit closest to the populations, the Municipality must be at the very heart of the social life of each citizen. In order to promote this state of affairs, municipalities develop projects, training, support, partnerships and investments. In the context of partnerships and international cooperation, the twinning model has always prevailed. But today, this model must be improved by putting more emphasis on the idea of ​​municipalities as a public unit for creating opportunities for SMEs or decentralized economic partnerships. Subsidies and subsidies from central governments no longer meet the requirements of local development and the empowerment of municipalities. We must therefore turn to economic partnerships and especially to international cooperation, in order to make possible opportunities for economic and commercial development between, on the one hand, the municipalities of Quebec and the municipalities of French-speaking Africa; but above all, on the other hand, between companies that are either municipal agencies or that operate within the municipal territory as local growth factors."
